This course is meant for Azure learners who want to achieve the AZ-104 Azure Administrator certification.
I tend to inspire, aid and support people through my learning journey and share my insights and experiences within Azure.
For this particular course, you can find all the materials in depth via the Wiki tab of this repository or by clicking on following link: https://github.com/GlennVandenborre/AZ-104-Azure-Administrators/wiki

This course will consist of 5 chapters:
1. Identities & Governance in Azure

3. Deploy & manage Azure Compute resources
4. Virtual Networking in Azure
5. Monitor & Backup Azure resources

This is of course a kick-off as this platform continues to grow.
